# Plot.ly - Belly Button Biodiversity

I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Plotly
- Bar and Pie plot to use the D3 library to read in `samples.json`. and create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Two Gauge Chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual
- Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
## D3
- Display the sample metadata (individual's demographic information.)

The final dashboard is shown below:
